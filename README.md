## What is Unclutter?  

**Unclutter** is a minimal yet powerful macOS utility that redefines how you organize your digital workspace. Designed for speed and simplicity, it provides **three functional panels** that appear instantly when you swipe down from the top of the screen — giving you seamless access to the things you use most.  

The **Clipboard Panel** saves everything you copy, letting you retrieve snippets of text or images from your history. It’s perfect for writers, coders, and multitaskers who copy and paste often.  

The **Notes Panel** replaces sticky notes and text files scattered around your Mac. Jot down quick ideas, reminders, or code fragments — all automatically saved and synced.  

The **Files Panel** is a lightweight temporary storage zone for documents and downloads. It keeps your desktop clutter-free while letting you drop, preview, and manage items with drag-and-drop ease.  

Unclutter runs natively on **Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3)** and Intel Macs, offering smooth animations, dark mode support, and full macOS integration. It’s ideal for professionals who value organization, students managing multiple projects, or anyone who wants to simplify their daily Mac workflow.  

With Unclutter, your Mac becomes more intuitive — where every note, file, and copied text is just one gesture away.
